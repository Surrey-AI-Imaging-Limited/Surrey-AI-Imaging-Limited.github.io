# Our work

**Large Area High-Resolution 3D Mapping of Mars.**

Large area, high-resolution, three-Dimensional (3D) mapping of the Martian surface is not only essential for performing key science investigations of the generation and evolution of the planet’s surface, but also critical for supporting existing and future surface robotic missions as well as human exploration. In this work, we demonstrate an end-to-end application of our in-house photogrammetric pipeline for 3D mapping of Valles Marineris, the largest system of canyons in the Solar System, using ESA Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera orbital images. In parallel, we demonstrate an application of our in-house deep learning-based surface modelling system to produce three large area 3D mapping products from single images taken from the ESA Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s Context Camera (CTX), the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) images, and the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) imaging data over the ExoMars 2022 Rosalind Franklin rover’s landing site at Oxia Planum on Mars. Both of the two 3D mapping products were made available through the ESA Guest Storage Facility and are being intensively exploited by the ExoMars' geological mapping team and visualisation team.

**Super-3D: subpixel-scale 3D reconstruction from Mar remote sensing imagery using deep learning based image super-resolution and monocular height estimation.**

High-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs or 3D models) play an important role in studying the formation processes involved in generating a modern-day planetary surface such as Mars. However, it has been a common understanding that DTMs derived from a particular imaging dataset can only achieve a lower, or at the best, similar effective spatial resolution compared to the input images, due to the various approximations and/or filtering processes introduced by the photogrammetric and/or photoclinometric pipelines. With recent successes in deep learning techniques, it is now become feasible to improve the effective resolution of an image using super-resolution restoration (SRR) networks, retrieving pixel-scale topography using single-image DTM estimation (SDE) networks, and subsequently, combine the two techniques to produce subpixel-scale topography from only a single-view input image.

**Super-resolution restoration of ultra-high-resolution satellite images.**

Increasing the spatial resolution of spaceborne imagery and video using ground-based processing, or, where feasible, onboard a smart satellite, allows greater amounts of information to be extracted about the scene content. Such processing is generally referred to as super-resolution restoration (SRR). SRR techniques are applicable to images and videos without the usual increased costs and mass, associated with increased bandwidth or larger/heavier optical components, normally required for achieving higher resolution. In particular, enhancing the ultra-high spatial resolution Earth observation (EO) images, or high definition (HD) videos, is an active driver for many applications in the fields of agriculture, forestry, energy and utility maintenance and urban geospatial intelligence. The ability to further improve 30 cm/80 cm EO images and videos into 10 cm/30 cm resolution SRR images and videos will allow EO analytics to be performed in transformative ways.

**Super-resolution restoration of high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images.**

In contrast to “photo-enhancing” super-resolution (SR/SRR) tasks, the desired SRR outputs of remote sensing applications are fundamentally different. In remote sensing applications, higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), minimised artefacts, sharper edges and object outlines, and ultimately, the higher image effective resolution, are much more desirable in comparison to “re-creating” high-frequency textures and/or objects. The original design of the popular photo-SR networks are based on the idea that human vision does not care if the generated high-frequency textures are not strictly correlated with the ground truth as long as they look realistic. Such generated high-frequency textures can significantly improve the “perceptual sharpness” but are considered artefacts in remote sensing or scientific applications. For example, satellite image users probably do not want a synthetic map even it looks extremely real. Therefore, we consider perceptual quality-driven SRR techniques are not suitable to be used directly in any remote sensing applications. In this work, we demonstrate our inhouse multi-spectral deep learning models for remote sensing image super-resolution restoration that improves the image effective resolution but with minimised "photo-realistic" artefacts.

**Multi-Image Cloud Detection and Tracking of Satellite VIS and TIR Images.**

Automated masking and tracking of the ever-changing cloud distributions captured by the Earth observation satellites are of fundamental importance to many remote sensing applications. For surface monitoring and land feature studies, clouds need to be masked and excluded from subsequent processing and analysis. On the other hand, for retrievals of geophysical parameters and atmospheric studies, clouds need to be tracked and extracted for subsequent processing and analysis. Although manual digitisation or using interactive cloud labelling tools can obtain fairly accurate cloud masks from still images, it requires a lot of time and resources, and is not considered effective for continuous cloud masking and tracking tasks. In this work, we use our in-house deep learning based 3D optical flow pipeline to track and compute the cloud motion vectors, and subsequently using a 3D geometry based automated cloud detection technique to produce accurate cloud masks from either single-camera continuous observation, multi-camera simultaneous observation, and/or multi-camera non-simultaneous observation.

**Automated multi-resolution image co-registration of Mars orbital datasets.**

Automated multi-resolution HiRISE (25 cm), CaSSIS (4.5 m), CTX (6 m) and HRSC (12.5 m) image co-registration is performed using global least squares fitting and mutual shape adapted feature matching algorithms. The co-registration accuracy achieved is up to the subpixel level of the coarser layer.

**Wide baseline stereo reconstruction of ground-based Mars rover imagery.**

In this work, we collect multi-view imaging data from ground-level robotic and orbital sensors covering the past and on-going Mars rover missions, e.g., Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and process them into a coherent set of co-registered 3D imaging products using our inhouse photogrammetric and structure from motion stereo reconstruction pipelines. We generate and fuse multi-resolution ground-level 3D models from different instruments onboard the same rover, e.g., Mastcam and Navcam from Curiosity, Pancam and Navcam from Spirit and Opportunity, using a combination of traditional computer vision algorithms, including subpixel-scale feature matching, region growing, bundle adjustment, and 3D point cloud co-alignment. These digitised multi-resolution 3D ground-level products enable the “virtual geologist” to perform close-up visual analysis of key Mar surface features, e.g., sedimentary layers, bedrocks, etc., and make measurements (e.g., distance, dip and slope) at the highest possible level of details and accuracy.
